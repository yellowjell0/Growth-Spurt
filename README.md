# Growth-Spurt
Growth Spurt is an online community for new or expecting parents to pair with parents whose children no longer have need for clothing, toys, or anything that another child may need. It is designed to be personal, so parents may only sign in with their Facebook accounts and may only use pictures with the accounts.
